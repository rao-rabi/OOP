# OOP
I have practiced whole OOP concepts from basic to advance in this repository.
OOP BASICS OUTLINE:

The main concepts are: Objects, Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.
1.	Overview of Structured Programming in C++
2.	Object-Oriented Concepts (Introduction to Classes and Objects) – Data Members and Member Functions – Constant Member Functions
3.	Use of Access Specifiers (public, private) – (Scope of class members) Constructor and Object Instantiation – Importance of Destructor
4.	Constructor Overloading (No-argument Constructor, Parameterized Constructor) – Introduction to copy constructors
5.	Composition: Complex classes composed of objects of other classes.
6.	Shallow Copy and Deep Copy – Array as class data members (Initializing array with constructors) – Static and Dynamic Arrays, Array of Objects
7.	File handling: how to open and close a file, read from file and write in a file(ifstream, ofstream, fstream).
8.	Introduction to single Public and Private Inheritance in OOP – Constructor and Destructor Chaining.
9.	Protected inheritance, Class Hierarchies (Multi-level Inheritance) – C++ Multiple Inheritance Entity-Relationship Modeling
10.	Function Overloading and Function Overriding – Object as argument to the Function – Pointer to Objects. Introduction to polymorphism.
11.	Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Base Classes – Virtual Inheritance (The Diamond Problem and its Solution)
12.	Relationships in OOP – (Association, Aggregation, and Composition) – Life Cycle and Ownership of Objects
13.	Friend Functions-Friend classes
14.	Operator Overloading – (Unary and Binary Operator Overloading) – Assignment Operator Overloading (Difference between Assignment Operator and Copy Constructor) – Stream Insertion and Extraction Operator Overloading
15.	Function Templates – Class Template Specialization, Standard Template Libraries
